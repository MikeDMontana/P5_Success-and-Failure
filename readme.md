# Success and Failure

## **THE GOAL:**

Design a success state, and a failure state, using sound, visual feedback, and DOM manipulation.

## **IDEAS:**

* UX - User Experience
* Interaction
* Visual Feedback
* Sonic Feedback

---

Crafting a strong user experience (UX) is about making interactions with an application more usable, and more pleasant.

We all crave feedback. When we click a button, we want to see something to happen that let's us know, "Did we do this right?".

I want all of you to keep in mind the ideas of *visual feedback* and *sonic feedback*. Each button press should trigger a sound, as well as a visual change on the page.

I'm providing a basic site for you, and the assignment for this weekend is for you to create your own success/failure state.

The sky is the limit! You don't have to stick with P5 if you don't want to. Check out my code in the finished branch if you are looking for some ideas.
